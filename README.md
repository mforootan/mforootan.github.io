### Student Life Data Integration  
**Tools**: Python, Power BI, Semantic models, AI prompting 

Developed an automated data pipeline integrating data from multiple university departments for operational insights. Designed dashboards to track student engagement, program outcomes, and operational KPIs. Conducted student satisfaction assessment using multiple correspondence analysis.

- Automated data cleaning and integration process from disparate systems.
- Created interactive dashboards, reducing reporting time for stakeholders.
- Increased data visibility across Student Life Effectiveness initiatives.

#### Highlights: Multiple Correspondence Analysis for student satisfaction data [(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/mforootan/AIU910/blob/main/MCA.ipynb)

* This report presents an analysis of student feedback data regarding study support, academic accessibility, and staff responsiveness. The analyst employed two statistical approaches: descriptive analysis examining frequency distributions and inferential analysis using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).
* Key findings reveal that Net Promoter Scores (NPS) were consistently high across all student groups, though senior students showed significantly lower survey participation. Many students hadn't used tutoring services, resulting in incomplete tutor-related responses. The MCA identified two main variation components: tutor usage and staff responsiveness (first component), and NPS with class standing (second component).
* Notable patterns emerged showing freshmen ranked NPS lower than sophomores and juniors, suggesting satisfaction increases with experience. Tutor-related metrics dominated the data variation, masking other parameters' relationships. The analysis revealed potential correlations between academic success, academic support, and clear communication, though statistical significance wasn't formally tested.
* The report recommends engaging senior students for their valuable long-term perspective, tracking students longitudinally to observe changing perceptions, and considering a simplified NPS scale given the skewed distribution toward high scores. The analyst suggests dedicated statistical tests are needed to properly assess correlations between non-tutor metrics, as current relationships remain masked by tutor-usage data.

### Miscellaneous Projects:
### Land Use Change in Tennessee - Nashville  Software School
**Tools**: Python (SciKit), R (ShinyApp)  

* The objective of this project was to elucidate patterns and hypothetical rationales for land use changes in Tennessee. It comprised two sub-projects:

    - [Phase I](https://github.com/mforootan/NSS_MidStone_TN_Land_Use) (powered by R & Shiny App): Visualizing land use alterations utilizing an interactive dashboard.

    - [Phase II](https://github.com/mforootan/NSS_Capstone_TN_land_use) (powered by Python & SciKit): Identifying determinants contributing to land use changes via dimension reduction techniques.

* A slideshow reviewing the methodology and results is included with the phase II set of files.

* The visualizations depicted various correlations between land availability and valuation across counties. Analyses suggested the predominant criteria influencing land value are proximity to major metropolitan areas and agricultural profitability.

* In summary, this project leveraged statistical programming languages and multivariate analysis to glean scientific insights into drivers of land use trends. The interactive dashboards and dimension reduction models provide data-driven understanding of how exurban dynamics shape land use patterns over time. Further research could relate the identified factors to policies on zoning, land conservation, transportation infrastructure, and urban development.

**Key Features**:
- Principal Component Analysis
- k-Nearest Neighbors

### [Improve College-Going and College-Readiness](https://github.com/mforootan/TN_DoE_College-Readiness) - Division of Research and Evaluation, TN Dept of Education
**Tools**: Python

* This repository comprises the data and computer code (in Python, in a Jupyter notebook) for an assessment project to identify measures that can evaluate high school graduates’ preparedness for collegiate studies.

* Researchers have a great interest in enhancing college readiness for all youth and increasing the rate of postsecondary enrollment among graduates. The community is equally passionate about improving its students’ postsecondary success. For many of these students, college is not perceived as a viable option. Researchers posit that the district can improve college readiness among all district students by first identifying high schools to serve as “models of excellence” and then learning from these exemplars about best practices for producing “college-ready” students who enroll and persist in postsecondary education. Therefore, the available data was examined to recommend a model school.

* Utilizing principal component analysis (aka dimension reduction), viable criteria were selected, upon which model schools were chosen. It appears that the most distinguishing factors to utilize for scoring are:

    * The standardized grades (mathematics, SAT assessments)
    * Enrolling for college. The two metrics that seem most relevant are: Enrolling for a 4-year degree (i.e., a strong education), and enrolling shortly after high school (an index of passion for education).

* However, regarding data quality, there were both missing values and duplicated entries in the dataset. The strategy to manage the data was deliberated and implemented. Further research avenues (disaggregating the data within sub-regions) were suggested.

**Key Features**:
- Principal Component Analysis

### [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/mforootan/NSS_Stat_LogReg) - Nashville Software School
**Tools**: Python

* This Jupyter notebook was developed to exhibit the concept of logistic regression and how to implement this technique in Python. The code generates a logistic regression model, prints the model summary, exports and prints the coefficients, calculates predicted probabilities, and visualizes the logistic regression model along with the original data. The logistic regression model is applied to a binary response variable based on an explanatory variable. The visualization helps to understand how well the logistic regression model fits the data.

##### ~ / m y _ l i f e / i n _ z e r o e s _ a n d _ o n e $

###### I stepped into the programming world in my teenage years with a [CASIO FX-702P](https://www.google.com/search?q=casio+fx+702p) calculator. Equipped with a collection of built-in math functions and a BASIC programming language environment, it was a suitable tool for those who were interested in automating simple to semi-complex math problems. When 8-bit home computers became popular (for dual use of gaming and programming), my pick was a [ZX-Spectrum +2](https://www.google.com/search?q=zx+spectrum+%2B2), pretty much for the same trend of programming interests. 

###### During my undergraduate years, as 16 & 32-bit PCs emerged, I started QBASIC and shortly afterward, [QuickBASIC](https://www.google.com/search?q=quickbasic). With genetics and statistics dominating my routine studies, digging into statistical programming turned into my top interest ([selected scripts](https://github.com/mforootan/QuickBASIC)). The big leap was starting to code for experimental designs and ANOVA, but before making significant progress, I learned about [MSTAT-C](https://www.google.com/search?q=mstatc), which sidetracked my interest in coding.

###### Meanwhile, Windows 3.x had already gotten into the market, and it was evident that the MS-DOS-based programming era was almost over. It didn’t take me long to find that Microsoft has released [Visual Basic](https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+basic+3), so I grabbed it and started migrating my old QB codes to the new platform to get my feet wet. With the upgrade to Windows 9x generation, I felt my programming skills had become obsolete, thus gradually abandoned programming and focused on mastering spreadsheets (started with Lotus 1-2-3 but quickly switched to [Excel](https://www.google.com/search?q=excel+4.0)) for data wrangling and exploration.

###### By starting postgraduate studies after a long gap, I was urged to use statistical tools again. The need for coding skills was raised again with Windows 98 in its glorious days and Windows 2000 and XP coming up, and statistical packages (Minitab, SPSS, and [SAS](https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/91pdf/)) have become more user-friendly than ever, and learning resources were pretty well populated and accessible. Yet I could hardly be happier when found out that Visual Basic has become the kernel of macro language in Microsoft Office, specifically Excel. The [VBA](https://www.google.com/search?q=vba) scripting and SAS package thus became my main tools for programming and statistical analysis for nearly 10 years ([selected ANOVA templates](https://github.com/mforootan/SAS_ODS)).

###### After relocating to the United States, I initially joined the IT-agribusiness sector, but after a while realized that my knowledge in statistics and coding was perilously out of date. This founded an incentive to join a data science boot camp and add [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) languages to my set of skills; followed by [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) for business intelligence purposes after rejoining the job market. Since then, my data analysis career journey in road safety, cancer genomics, and education industry has prompted exploring business management and data wrangling tools such as [REST-API](https://www.google.com/search?q=rest-api), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), [Smartsheet](https://smartsheet.com/), albeit with the aid of AI tools, and I'm looking forward to reconciling my cross-domain experience to develop solutions for seamless and robust data streaming.

##### . . / f u n _ f @ c t $
###### - My first email, registered in 1999, was an MS-DOS-based powered by [Pegasus Mail](http://www.pmail.com/overviews/ovw_pmail.htm). 
###### - I was among the first round of [Blogger](http://massihforootan.blogspot.com/) users who were invited by Google to register for Gmail in 2004 ([Story](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2004/apr/21/bloggerusersg)). Despite a wide range of usernames being available (including both my first and last name individually), I preferred to coin the very fourteen-character username I already had with Yahoo since 1999 (registered a few days after the Pegasus one) as my online identity. 
###### - Since then, I have owned email addresses with .net, .com, .ac.uk, .ac.ir, .gov, .org, and .edu domains; in that order.
###### - I am an Inbox Zero.
