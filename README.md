## :: Fatal and Serious Injury Crashes
###### Tennessee Integrated Traffic Analysis Network, TN Dept of Safety & Homeland Security
This SQL / Tableau-powered [dashboard](https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/safety/stats/dashboards.html) contains near-to-live interactive information on fatal and serious injury crashes on Tennessee roadways for the current and previous years.

## :: Land Use change in Tennessee
###### Nashville Software School
The objective of the project was to explore the pattern and hypothetical reasons for the changes in land use in Tennessee.
It consisted of two sub-projects:
- [Phase I](https://github.com/mforootan/TN_Land_Use) (R & Shiny App): Visualizing the land use changes with an interactive dashboard.
- [Phase II](https://github.com/mforootan/NSS_Capstone) (Python & SciKit): Identifying the measures that contribute to the land use changes using dimension reduction. A PowerPoint slideshow is included in this section that reviews the methodology and results.

## :: Logistic Regression
###### Nashville Software School
This [notebook](https://github.com/mforootan/LogReg) was created to demonstrate the concept of logistic regression, and how to implement one in Python.

My life; in zeroes and ones

I stepped into the programming world in my teens with a 
CASIO FX-702P programmable calculator. With a collection 
of built-in math functions, it was a suitable tool for 
those who were interested in automating simple to 
semi-complex math problems. When the home computers 
became popular (for dual use of gaming and BASIC 
programming), my pick was a ZX-Spectrum +2, pretty much 
for the same trend of programming interests. 

After PCs became popular during my undergrad, I started 
QBASIC and shortly afterward, QuickBASIC. With genetics 
and statistics dominated my routine studies, digging 
into programming statistical procedures became my top
interest. The big leap was starting to code for 
experimental designs, but before making significant 
progress, I learned about MSTAT-C, a small package 
for solving experimental designs, and my passion was 
stalled.

Meanwhile, Windows 3.x had already entered the market, 
and it was evident that the MS-DOS-based programming 
era is almost over. It didnâ€™t take me long to find 
that Microsoft has released Visual Basic, so I grabbed 
it and started migrating my old QB codes to the new 
platform to get my feet wet. When Windows 9x generation 
emerged, I felt my programming skills are now obsolete, 
and gradually quit programming and focused on using 
spreadsheets (started with Lotus 1-2-3 but switched 
to Excel in a very short time) for data tinkering and 
exploration.

By starting postgraduate studies after a long gap, 
I was urged to use statistical tools again. The need 
for coding skills raised again with Windows 98 at its 
glorious days and Windows 2000 and XP on the way, 
statistical packages (Minitab, SPSS, and SAS) have 
become more user-friendly than ever, and online learning 
resources were pretty handy. Yet I could hardly be happier 
when found out that Visual Basic has become the kernel 
of macro language in Microsoft Office, specifically Excel. 
Thus VBA and SAS became my main tools for programming 
and statistical analysis for nearly 10 years.

Moving to the US, I started working in an IT-agribusiness 
company, realizing that my knowledge in statistics and 
coding is perilously out of date, and a refresh appears 
to be a must-have, and ultimately my incentive to join 
a data science boot camp and add Python and R languages 
to my toolbox; followed by Tableau and SQL as my in hand 
tools for business intelligence purposes.

Fun f@cts: 
- My first email, registered in 1999, was an MS-DOS-based 
  powered by Pegasus Mail. 
- I was among the first round of blogger users who were 
  invited by Google to register for Gmail . Although 
  massih@gmail.com was available, I preferred to use the 
  same username I already had with Yahoo since 1999 
  (registered a few days after the Pegasus one). 
- Since then, I have owned personal email addresses with 
  .com, .net, .ac, and .gov domains.
